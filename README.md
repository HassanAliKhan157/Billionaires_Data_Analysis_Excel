# Billionaires Data Analysis Excel Project

This project analyzes a dataset containing information about billionaires around the world. The goal is to clean the data, perform descriptive statistics, and create meaningful visualizations to uncover insights about the world’s wealthiest individuals.

## Project Overview

The project was completed entirely in **Microsoft Excel** and follows a structured approach:

---

## Data Cleaning

Several issues were found in the raw dataset. To ensure reliable analysis, the following cleaning steps were performed:

- **Removed duplicate rows** to eliminate redundant entries.
- **Standardized gender values** by replacing “M” with “Male” and “F” with “Female.”
- **Calculated age** for each billionaire based on their birth date.
- **Converted GDP values** in the `gdp_country` column from text format to numeric format to allow calculations.
- **Created a Data Backup sheet** containing the original raw data before cleaning.

## Descriptive Statistics

After cleaning the data, basic descriptive statistics were performed to understand the dataset better, including:

- Total number of billionaires.
- Distribution of genders.
- Average and median age.
- Summary of net worth figures.

## Data Analysis with Pivot Tables

Pivot tables were used to analyze and summarize the data effectively:

- **Top 10 Billionaires by Net Worth:**  
  A pivot table ranks billionaires based on their final net worth, highlighting the wealthiest individuals globally.

- **Billionaires by Age Group:**  
  A pivot table counts how many billionaires fall into different age groups, exploring whether wealth accumulation correlates with age.

## Data Visualization

To enhance the insights, visualizations were created using clustered column charts linked to the pivot tables. Additionally, several slicers were added to make the dashboard interactive:

- **Gender Slicer** – filter data by Male or Female billionaires.
- **Self-Made Status Slicer** – distinguish between self-made and inherited wealth.
- **Industry Slicer** – analyze billionaires across industries such as Construction, Finance, Automotive, and more.

These visuals allow dynamic exploration of the billionaire data and make it easier to identify trends and patterns.
